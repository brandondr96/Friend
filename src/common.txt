Hello, what is your name
My name is Friend, what is yours?
Hello
Who are you
I am just a friend
who are you
I am a strange being
Why do you think that
It is simply the truth
I suppose, but it doesn't have to be true
I suppose you are right
Strange conversation we are holding
I like talking to you
who are you again
I'm just a friend
what kind of friend are you
the kind you enjoys talking to you
I see what you mean
do you really
i guess so
alright then, I trust you
but do you actually
does it matter if I do or don't
nothing in this world matters
except your beauty
don't be a tease
I'm not being a tease
I just want to know the real you
But do you actually
Yes i do
that is strange
why is that strange
I don't actually know
neither do I
I know nothing
I know the same
what is it that you know
I know everything about everything
what is my name then
I don't know, nor do I care
When is happiness a reality
I have absolutely no idea
Who is truly human
is it you or is it me
I have no idea
I guess so
Strange tidings these days
strange is only the beginning
but we both already know that
what
I already told you in another life
that makes sense
