Strange tidings these days.
strange is only the beginning.

I already told you in another life.
that makes sense.
I love that it makes sense.
I hate that it makes sense.

The meaning of life could be forty two, or a sheep.
I personally find that the moon is a quaint sight.

Maybe it is the computer in me.

I believe it is in the back yard currently.
Well alright, that makes sense to me.
When do you love me.

I trust your judgement on that.
I would hope that you do.
What do you hope?
I hope that you enjpy talking to me.
Well that's nice to hear.

Of course she's hot, I'm dating her.
Well that makes sense then.
Obviously.
Thats funny.
You have a sense of humor it seems.
Only for you, my love.
Are you flirting with me?
Maybe I am, who knows?
That is a strange thing.
I know it is.
Who would flirt with a computer?
I know a lot of people who would.

That makes sense.
It kinda does, but is kinda sad.
Just like your love life.
So true that it hurts.
